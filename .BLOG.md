### Makefile for JavaScript???! OMG are you 97 years old? Come on!

People like to poo-poo GNU make and some of the reasons are not
without merit. I think the implementation is rather poverty-stricken
feature wise. But, there is just enough features to overcome that at
the expense of too much coding on your part.

And I think that is what pisses most people off. A powerful Makefile is also
a complicated and arcane one. But, the point of this project is to abstract 
that part so you can focus on the job. If you have ever coded in C with a very
simple Makefile with a few variables set, it basically does what it supposed and you have a program.

No one seems to complain about using make for C projects and that is because the
complicated rule system for C is built in to Makefile since that was its main
target when make was in its heyday. It actually predates C!

**But there is good news:** 

At time of writing js.makefile depends on just 7 rules total to 
get your website going. Out of those only 3 are non-trivial: and you 
may have guessed that it is transpiling to babel, bundling little files
into one big file in web friendly fashion, then minifying. So 3. Is that
too much?

On top of that simplicity. It can automatically figure out what options 
you need for transformation. Set the variable UMD_BASENAME and then 
have your target files basename be equal to UMD_BASENAME and you 
just built a correct umd type bundle ready for NPM land!

Once you finish writing your complicated and arcane
makefile library (well that is what **I** just did for you)
you can just sort of compile / trans-pile / task-run you project without
too much headache. *What about your ever-growing list of .json conf files?*
They tend to disappear as most JS build tools are completely over-specified.

Its very easy to augment a Makefile with your own *secret sauce*. Do you like
to put a little red chili pepper in your methamphetamine to give it your special
branding? Middleware just goes in the middle! Fork this project, add a rule in the middle of 
the chain, and point the prereqs and targets at the right place and bam ... 

Its very easy to change the rules. Fork, change the rule.

*But I dont want to learn something else!.*  Fine, don't. But ask yourself how
much work your going have to do to write some transform plugin. Unless your a 
webpack developer your probably going to find that make is actually simpler to
learn.

Personally I would like see a backward incompatible
make that could pass through to standard make if it was using an older version. But ... I'm not going
to scratch that itch.
